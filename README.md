# gadigElectionGame

This is a BIG F YOU to the people who made drag race sim. 
For context, we had made it an annual tradition to use one of the sim games for gadig.
After they had monitized and used community devlopers to make a complete overhaul of their old site, I reached out to the people there and asked if the old code woudl be released
They gave me a profanity filled rant about not using their code and being lazy to just a simple POLITE request.

F them. Community code is for EVERYONE! This repo is a sim game so that anyone can have fun with their friends. 
Simple to navigate, just change the events dictionary and anything else you'd like for the themeing.
